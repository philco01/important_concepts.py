#OOP

# in class we need to define variables with empty values
# class random_name:
#     property_name = " "
#     number_property = 0
#
#     def some_function(self):
#         print("...")
#     def some_function(self):
#         print("...")
#
# objecto = random_name()
# objecto.property_name = ",,,iwcij"
# self its a way for class to know which object to call
# self is refer to properties of class

@staticmethod # use class name to refer to variable
def demo():
    print("...")
